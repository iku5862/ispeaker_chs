Now to do this, <span data-index='1'>I've divided my presentation into three parts</span>. <span data-index='1'> Firstly I'll talk about</span> the background to the research, <span data-index='1'>then we'll look at</span> how we approached the research <span data-index='1'>and thirdly I'll summarize</span> the key findings of the research. <span data-index='2'>So let's start with</span> a brief description of the background...<br>...<br>So once we'd selected the 90,000 customers across your company's three regions, we then emailed them the survey. We allowed four weeks for them to respond to the surveys and after that period we received a 4% response rate. Now this is quite good for this type of survey. We then analysed those responses and compiled them in a report for you. <span data-index='2'>Let's look at those responses in a bit more detail</span>. Now of that 4%, this blue section shows that 57% of those responses came from the region with the difficulties. That's significant as you are more likely to receive responses from customers who are either very satisfied or very unsatisfied. Anyway, <span data-index='3'>this leads me on to the third and main part of my presentation</span>: the actual results of the survey. Now in front of you, there's a copy of the survey's findings...<br>...<br><span data-index='4'>I'm going to summarize</span> the key findings for each of these questions. So <span data-index='2'>let's begin with</span> question one, which asks your customers how likely they are to recommend your company to a friend. <span data-index='5'>As you can see</span>, we have used a scale, with zero being not at all likely and ten being extremely likely. <span data-index='5'>According to this chart</span>, the overall response indicates that customers are fairly likely to recommend your company. However, <span data-index='5'>this chart represents</span> an average response across the three regions. If we break these responses down into the three regions like this, <span data-index='5'>it illustrates</span> the difference in customer satisfaction region by region. Now remember, red and yellow are the regions with increasing numbers of customers. <span data-index='4'>Consequently,</span> the responses are quite high, even as high as ten, but the lower scores in the previous chart were caused by the decline in these blue responses here. They go down to the zero level in some cases."],
